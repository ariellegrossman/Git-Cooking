Coffee foam served on a brewed coffee (as opposed to milk). I find the flavours compliment each other nicely, and the heat of the coffee interacts with the foam better. You can hand-whip it instead of using a mixer, but it takes a while.

## Ingredients

- 2 spoons of instant coffee (or 6&sbsp;g)
- 2 spoons of white sugar (or 21&sbsp;g)
- 2 spoons of hot water (or 20&sbsp;ml)
- 1 cup of brewed coffee

## Instructions

1. Combine ingredients in medium sized bowl
2. Mix with a whisk or mixer until homogenous and foam-y, like medium-stiff peaks
3. Brew pour-over coffee and pour into a mug
4. Spoon foam onto the surface of the coffee

### Notes

This drink is quite sugar-y, and very caffinated (about 5 cups-worth of coffee). If you want it more caffinated you could add a shot of espresso to the brewed coffee, but at the risk of a heart-attack.
