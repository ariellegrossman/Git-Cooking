## Instructions

1. To make the pickles, julienne the carrots and daikon. Place carrots and daikon along with hot peppers in a jar, and then pour boiling vinegar, water, salt and sugar into the jar, making sure everything is fully submerged. 
2. Allow the pickles to sit for at least an hour, or overnight in the fridge (better).
3. To make the marinated tofu, pat the tofu dry and combine all ingredients into a ziploc (make more marinade than you think you'll need). Allow to rest for at least half an hour. 
4. Once tofu has finished marinating,  slice into thin long rectangles and fry in some oil on a hot pan. Finish by spooning marinade on both sides until crisp.
5. If using a store bought baguette, slice into sandwhich sized pieces and slice lengthwise. If using homemade bahn mi baguettes, just slice lengthwise. 
6. Assemble bahn mi by coating bread with a generous amount of mayo, placing down tofu, and covering with pickles and cilantro (put lots of both). Finish with a squeeze of lime.

### Notes

The marinade for the tofu has a lot of shrimp in it, so if you wish to make it vegetarian you can omit the shrimp paste and just use concentrated veggie stock instead. To replace the tom yum paste, use tamarind paste, lemongrass, and scallions. This recipie wasn't really adapted from anywhere and is just how I prefer to make my Bahn Mi's!
