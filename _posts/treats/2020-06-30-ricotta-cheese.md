- splash of cream
- 1 tsp of salt
- 1/3 cup of lemon juice

</section>

## Instructions

1. Slowly bring the 2 liters of milk and cream to a simmer (200 F) in a large pot
2. As soon as the simmer is reached, throw in the salt and lemon juice, quickly stir for a few seconds, and take it off the heat
3. Allow the pot to rest and the curds to form for 10 minutes untouched
4. Drain the mixture through a fine strainer or cheesecloth for 5-15 minutes

### Notes

If you prefer a higher moisture cheese, only let the ricotta drain for around 5 minutes. For a drier ricotta, allow it to dry for 15-20 minutes. If you don't have a thermometer you can still pull off this recipie, just watch very carefully for steam and light bubbling before adding the acid. It is best to drain the ricotta through cheese cloth, but a fine mesh strainer can be used as well. Recipie from thekitchn.com.
