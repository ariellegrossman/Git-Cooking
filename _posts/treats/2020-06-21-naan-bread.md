3. Combine yogurt, flour, salt, yeast/water mixture, and 1 tbs of strained garlic butter until a shaggy dough is formed
4. Knead shaggy dough for 4-5 minutes until the dough springs back lightly to the touch
5. Grease bowl with some strained garlic butter and allow dough to rise for 1-2 hours. Once it has doubled in size, punch it down and shape it into a rectangle. 
6. Cut the rectangle into 6 equal pieces, roll them into balls and cover them with plastic wrap for 15-20 minutes to proof the dough
7. Roll out each ball into a long naan shape (some flour dusting may be required)
8. Cook the naan for a few minutes on each site on a dry and searing hot cast iron skillet 
9. Brush the  naan with the remaining garlic butter

### Notes

It is best to use natural yogurt, but sweetened vanilla yogurt can work in a pinch. The naan tastes great made in a wooden oven or finished on a bbq. Recipie from foodwishes youtube channel.
