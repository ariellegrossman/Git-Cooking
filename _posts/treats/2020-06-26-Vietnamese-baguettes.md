2. Mix water and sugar and yeast, allow yeast to bloom, and then whisk in one egg (should equal roughly 250 ml of liquid at the end)
3. Place lime juice in milk until it curdles
4. Add both milk and egg mixture into bread bowl, along with one tbs of vegetable oil
5. Mix and form a shaggy dough
6. Knead for 15 minutes
7. Tuck sides underneath the dough to form a taught ball, cover, and allow to rise for 20 minutes
8. Divide the dough into 6 parts
9. Flatten dough out into a triangle, then roll it back onto itself into a cylinder, pinching the back flap together and rolling to seal
10. Place the baguettes in an oven with the light on for 60 minutes along with two cups with 150 ml of boiling water in each 
11. Preheat the oven to 464 F. Allow the bread to rise for 10 more minutes on the counter, and then deeply score the baguettes in a single slice through the middle. 
12. Pour 200 ml of boiling water on the tray below the baguettes and then turn the oven down to 446 F. Allow to bake for 15-17 minutes. 
13. Brush the warm baguettes with butter. 

### Notes

These baguettes are not a traditional french baguette, but rather the vietnamese interpretation. They are delicious on their own, but especially go well when used for making bahn mi's. Recipie was taken from Diá»…m Nauy's youtube channel.
