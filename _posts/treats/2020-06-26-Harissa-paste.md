## Instructions

1. Toast all spices in a dry pan for a minute or until fragrant
2. Crush spices to a powder in a mortar and pestle
3. Blend all ingredients in a food processor until mostly smooth, add olive oil as needed

### Notes

Adapted from the minimalist baker. Most ingredients can be easily substituted, dried & rehydrated chiles or other fresh hot peppers can be used in place of thai peppers, home roasted red peppers can be used instead of jarred pimentos, and sundried tomatoes can be replaced with tomato paste.
