## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 F
2. Grease ramekins (or muffin tin) with butter, dust with flour
3. Beat eggs with an electric mixer until doubled in volume, around two and half minutes
4. Add in dulce de leche, blend until well combined, and then add in flour and continue blending until well combined
5. Pour batter into ramekins, leaving a little bit of headspace, and place into the oven on a rimmed baking sheet for around 12 minutes (centers should still jiggle)
6. Serve with ice cream

### Notes

The only tricky part of this recipie is making sure you don't overcook the cakes. It is better to remove them a bit earlier as they will solidify a bit more once out of the oven. Use a knife to remove them from the ramekins if they get stuck, but they should slide out easily if a good amount of butter and flour was used. Recipie from bon appetit.
