## Instructions

1. Mix all dry ingredients and sugar into a bowl
2. Add and mix in blueberries
3. Mix milk, butter, and egg in a small bowl
4. Add wet mix to large bowl and combine
5. Place mix into muffin tin into a 380 degrees F oven for 20-25 minutes

### Notes

The muffins need to sit for around 5-10 minutes after being taken out of the oven to firm up. Sprinkling a bit of sugar ontop of the raw batter could make a nice crust, and blueberries can be substituted for any other fresh/frozen fruit on hand. Recipie from allrecipies.com.
